Before having my first in person appointment, she took the time to schedule a phone appointment to listen to my concerns and thoroughly assess my needs. What I appreciated most was the personalized treatment plan that she developed specifically for me and my goals. I felt supported and motivated throughout the process, and am grateful for the time we had working together. If you're looking for a dedicated and attentive physical therapist, I highly recommend Dr. Shreya."
